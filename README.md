# 1-D-Random-Walk

In mathematics, a random walk is a random process that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space.

An elementary example of a random walk is the random walk on the integer number line, which is the One-Dimensional Random Walk implemented in our case.

We have taken cases where the person starts from the
- Origin
- Random Miscellaneous Point
- Two People Random Walking

In this we try to plot each and see where the distribution is curving towards \
We have also graphed the skewness of the walk \
Another thing is to see the collision of the two random walks, to see if they were intersect each other and concurrent paths.
